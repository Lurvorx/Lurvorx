Crafting unique experiences in the FiveM community

About Me

Hello! I'm Lurvorx, a passionate FiveM developer currently working on creating engaging and optimized scripts for the ESX Legacy framework. I am also learning and expanding my skills in:

Lua (primary scripting language for FiveM)

HTML & CSS (for building UI/UX)

JavaScript (enhancing interactivity)

React, Vue, and Vuetify (for modern front-end development)

I aim to combine my technical skills with creativity to produce high-quality scripts for the FiveM community.

Lurvorx Scripts

I own Lurvorx Scripts, a shop dedicated to selling custom FiveM scripts. Our goal is to deliver premium, well-optimized scripts tailored to the needs of server owners.
